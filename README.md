# ImbaYangu-Housing-App
ImbaYangu is a housing app that uses map integration to help users find apartment listings in their desired location by entering latitude and longitude coordinates.

## Project Motivation
The name ImbaYangu means "My Home" in Shona, a language spoken in Zimbabwe. This name was chosen to reflect the cultural context and to create something personally meaningful and locally relevant for a Zimbabwean audience. The project began as a way to explore how location-based services could make it easier for people to find housing that meets their needs. It is a work in progress, with plans to expand and refine its features for better usability and accessibility.

## Project Outcomes
Users can view a list of apartment listings.

Each listing includes details such as price, address, and square footage.

A map is displayed using latitude and longitude values entered by the user.

The app demonstrates functional integration of maps and custom views in SwiftUI.

## Possible Improvements
Improve the location experience by allowing users to search by address or location name, instead of manually entering latitude and longitude.

Add filtering and sorting for listings (e.g., by rent, size, or distance).

Implement real-time data fetching from a remote database or API.

Enhance user interface design and error handling for location permissions.
